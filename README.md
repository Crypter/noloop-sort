# noloop-sort
The one and only sorting algorithm\* without iteration - O(1) time complexity!

\**The sorting algorithm is loseless up to 2 elements*
## Sorting function overview
noloop-sort(array[], order)
- array[] - Array to be sorted with known\* item count
- order - ordering of the elements, values: undef, ascending, descending

\**While this is a limitation of the current code, the algorithm can be extended to accept arrays with unknown item count while maintaining O(1)*
